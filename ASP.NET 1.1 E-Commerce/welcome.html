<p><font face="Arial">Dear Reader,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Welcome to the 2nd edition of Beginning ASP.NET 
E-Commerce! We really hope you'll enjoy reading this book, and that it will 
effectively help you build your own websites with ASP.NET, VB.NET and SQL 
Server!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This archive contains three folders:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>ImageFolders</b>: contains the Images and ProductImages 
folders which you'll need for testing the sample website we create in this book.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Code</b>: contains the ASP.NET projects for JokePoint, for every chapter of the 
book.<b> </b>In order to run the code provided, you will need IIS, which is not 
installed by default on your Windows set-up. Issues relating to IIS are 
discussed in Appendix A, but as far as this code goes, all that is necessary to 
run it is to create a virtual directory corresponding to the absolute path in 
the code, as explained in Chapter 02.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Database</b>: contains the database creation scripts for the tables, stored 
procedures, and functions.</font></p>
